            <h2>About IAN Centre</h2>
            <p>
                Information and Action Network Centre is a unique local Humanitarian and Development Network of individuals and institutions 
                concerned with people exercising basic human rights, capable of influencing or determining the systems and structures which govern them. 
                IAN CENTRE was founded and registered in Kenya in September 2007 to promote the sharing of knowledge, dialogue, and understanding of legal, 
                political, and socio-economic systems necessary for contributing meaningfully to issues affecting development and making intelligent decisions about them.
            </p>
            <p>
                The AIM is to infuse greater rights awareness amongst Kenyans because an aware person acts from an enlightened position.

        <h2>Our Major Concerns</h2>
        <p>
            Our major concern is substantive democratic advancement and the rule of law. We ask whether Kenya will ever achieve substantive 
            democratic advancement in the context of changes in political leadership and arrangements in a political context without principle. 
            Any thinking Kenyan is able to worry about the future of this country.
